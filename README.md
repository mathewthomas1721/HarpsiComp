# Harpsichord 
A very basic PyGame program that generates harpsichord sounds using the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It also includes a metronome with polyrhythm functionality. PyGame and Tkinter must be installed. I believe Tkinter is available by default with Python installations, but pygame can be installed as follows :


sudo apt-get install python-pygame
